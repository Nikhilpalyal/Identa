##IDENTA

1. Project Overview
IDENTA is an Autonomous Identity Operating System designed to model human cognition, enforce strategic identity governance, simulate digital impact before execution, and autonomously manage digital presence with long‑term positioning in mind.

The system operates at the identity layer — not the content layer — integrating cognitive modeling, strategic intelligence, and governed execution into a unified architecture.

2. Functional Requirements

2.1 Identity Initialization
User authentication and secure onboarding

Multi-platform integration (LinkedIn, Instagram, X, YouTube, etc.)

Upload of historical content (text, audio, video)

Biometric identity verification

Goal, positioning, and boundary configuration

2.2 Cognitive Modeling Engine
Behavioral pattern extraction

Tone and narrative analysis

Belief consistency mapping

Risk appetite modeling

Identity drift detection mechanism

2.3 Strategic Intelligence Layer
Real-time trend monitoring

Audience engagement analytics

Opportunity-risk evaluation

Strategic silence protocol activation

Pre-publication decision simulation

2.4 Autonomous Execution Engine
Identity-aligned content generation
